    "# Welcome to section 2 of this course \n",
    "Section two will focus more on the data part of python, whereas in the first sections we covered the foundation. When we work with data in Python, we can do so in many ways, such as using lists and dictoronairs filled with integers, strings and many more. However, one of the most common and easy ways to work with data in Python is by using **DataFrames**. Dataframes are very similair to 2-Dimensional Excel tables (or SQL output for that matter) and are thus very recognizable and interpretable for us humans. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, by default, Python does not work with Dataframes out of the box. Fortunately, as we've seen two weeks ago, Python has many openly available additional libraries and modules. We've already worked very briefly with Numpy, probably the most commonly used library in Python. Second in this list is Pandas. Pandas is a python library designed to make many common types of data analysis straightforward and can be used to work with Dataframes, making it is incredibly useful for grouping data, aggregating and processing these groups, and reshaping data. Support for time-series analyses in Pandas is also strong with built-in date and time representations. Thus, long story short: Pandas is exactly what we need! Especially if we reconsider these monthly tasks that we used to do manually in Excel. Pandas to the rescue! Additionally, as Pandas is so commenly used, Google knows the answer to almost everything regarding pandas! \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, get yourself some cofee, because the real fun starts here!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we'll walk through the possibilities of Pandas using a car data set from an car action centre in Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA. P.S. Did you know that the state of Oklahoma sees the most tornados annually out of all US states? Also, it was the first state where a parking meter was installed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data is in a .csv file, which is one of the most common ways to transfer data. As we've seen before, we can open .csv's with Excel and opt to split the cells based on the comma. However, hopefully after today, you'll give it a go using Python pandas. "

    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "Before we start doing anything, we have to make sure we import the correct libraries. Thus, we **import pandas** using exactly that statement. without important pandas, we'll get an error when we try to use it. If we use something from the library, we need to specifiy which library we're using. Thus, we start every specific pandas commando (code-line) with *pandas.*. We'll see in litle bit how this works out. Additionally, we need to know where our datafile is. In our case, we've put everything in the same folder, but we can go a level down in our folder structure if we wish to do so. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have pandas imported and know the location of our .csv datafile, we can start openen our data! We can do so using `'pandas.read_csv('document.csv')'` and assign it to a variable. If we assign it to variable, we still have to display our results, like we've seen with the print() statement. However, as displaying an entire dataframe with data can be quite cumbersome, there is an option to only show to the top or final section of the dataframe using `'.head()'` or `'.tail()'`. Let's see how this works.\n",

As we don't prefer to see that, we add `'index_col=0'` to our read_csv statement, making our dataframe a little bit more sleek. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, lets use another trick. As typing *pandas* all day long might bore you, we can do a simpeler import statement.  `'import pandas'` and `'import pandas as pd'` both import pandas, but now we don't need to type `'pandas.read_csv(\"USA_cars_datasets.csv\")'` anymore, but only `'pd.read_csv(\"USA_cars_datasets.csv\")'` suffices, saving us potentially valuable time ! :) "

If we won't specify anything, except for the 2 dataframes to be combined, we'll be able to merge them quickly, as long as there is an overlap in the columnnames. Thus, if you change the dataframe creation above (or copy it to this block) and ensure that the columnnames are just \"Gemeente\" in both, it should work automatically with just pandas.merge(df, df2)!"

    "I would just like to state that pandas is the go-to tool for data analysis in python, and there is just no way to talk you through it in a couple of hours. It requires some practise to do all actions instantly and some google'ing to find all the inns-and-outs of pandas, but the functions are really intuitive and the sky is the limit. Personally, when I started working with Pandas I used the DataCamp pandas cheatsheet a lot, which can be found here: http://datacamp-community-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/dbed353d-2757-4617-8206-8767ab379ab3. This cheatsheet contains the basics (how to open a csv and excel file), but also comes in handy when you want to select data. Additionally, I think it is very valuable to browse throught the pandas website for some minutes, especially their 10 minute starter guide: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/10min.html. \n",

We'll definitely no go into detail here (since my diploma won't be worth anything if we do). After this, the chapter concludes with some exercises. We haven't covered all the materials to succesfully finish these exercises, hence you will need to go on an adventure yourself! "

    "One of the most powerfull actions in pandas is that you can actually call a function on a dataframe. We do this, by adding `.apply(function_name)` to our dataframe (which can also be a specific column). To show you this, we quickly import the car sales data from the US again, and then make a very simple function stating that cars sold < 1000 are cheap, 1000 - 10000 are priced normal and > 10000 are expensive. From a data analysis perspective, this obviously makes no sense, but hope it helps in understanding the .apply method in pandas. A very usefull tool. \n",
